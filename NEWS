Version 1.1
o Changed some internals of the plotting functionality to make it work
  with a GenomeGraphs update.
o The new version of DBI (0.2-5) fixes the name mangling of the SQL 
  reserved keyword "end".  Workarounds for this mangling has been
  removed and Genominator now depends on DBI >= 0.2-5.
o Changed importFromAlignedReads to have only one argument 'x' instead
  of 'alignedReads' and 'filenames'.
o Added functionality to importFromAlignedReads so that it is possible
  to immediately collapse several files together, at the cost of
  having them all in memory at the same time (this later point might
  be changed).
o Added a check to importToExpData so that only rows with
  non-missing values of (chr, location, strand) gets written to the
  database.
o Fixed the connection pool to be outside of individual ExpData
  objects. This elucidated a hitherto unknown bug where a user could
  inadvertently write to a read-only database. 
o Added groupBy to summarizeByAnnotation
o Added to Bioconductor
o Improved User Guide substantially
o (Internal) Changed a few tryCatch statements to use the SQL
  "... IF EXISTS ..." instead.
o Changed the db and filename to be in sync: there is now only
  a dbFIlename slot in ExpData and all functions accept dbFilename.
o Added CITATION

Version 1.0

NEW FEATURES
o Changed underlying database model where now the database exists in two
  modes, either a read or write mode. This should be somewhat transparent
  to the end user.
o Added importFromAlignedRead which allows the importing of objects read
  using readAligned from ShortRead package.
o Added support for arbitrary index columns, this support allows for
  the inclusion of more complex types of reads, e.g. reads of different
  lengths or paired end reads. This support is preliminary, but should
  allow for a mix of representations.
o Added '$' and '[' methods to expData objects to directly query the
  database. 
o Fixed vignette to more correctly describe splitByAnnotation.
o Added ability to filter the reads when importing an Eland export file.
o Added whereClause to summarizeExpData.
o Added sample = FALSE argument to plot function for goodness of fit plots.
  This allows one to plot fewer than all of the points for smaller pdfs. 
o Added regionGoodnessOfFit.df to work with matrices or data.frames. 
o Added in-memory ordering to importToExpData; this speeds things up
  considerably when indexing.

	       	    

BUG FIXES
o Fixed bug where colnames are trashed when preserveColnames = T and
  bindAnno = T
o Modified fix below when we include "what" argument. 
o Fixed bug in splitByAnnotation when expand = TRUE and addOverStrands = TRUE
  and only one strand was present in the sequencing reads. 
o Fixed bug in splitByAnnotation when expand = TRUE where reads were
  lost.
